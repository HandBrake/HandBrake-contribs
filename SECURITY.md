# Security Policy

## Download Mirror only!

Please be aware, this repository acts as a download mirror for 3rd party libraries that HandBrake uses. This includes all historical, unsupported versions. 

The HandBrake team does not support these libraries.  Any security concerns with these libraries should be reported to the upstream project.

Please do not use this repository as a mirror for other projects as it may not contain the latest releases of upstream projects!

If you believe the *current* version of HandBrake is using a venerable library, please follow the disclosure policy on https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/security/policy
